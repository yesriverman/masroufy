# how can i always force the retrieval of the current user data in all models or views
# To always enforce retrieval of the current user's data across your Django models and views â€” especially in a privacy-first, multi-tenant architecture like yours â€” youâ€™ll want to build automated safeguards that make it nearly impossible to forget scoping by user.

# Hereâ€™s a modular, scalable approach that fits your philosophy:

# âœ… 1. Use a Custom Manager for User-Scoped Queries
# python
# # managers.py
# from django.db import models

# class UserScopedManager(models.Manager):
#     def for_user(self, user):
#         return self.get_queryset().filter(user=user)
# Then in your model:

# python
# class Group(models.Model):
#     name = models.CharField(...)
#     user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

#     objects = UserScopedManager()
# Now in views:

# python
# groups = Group.objects.for_user(request.user)
# This makes scoping explicit and reusable.

# âœ… 2. Use a Base View Mixin for Auto-Scoping
# python
# # mixins.py
# class UserQueryMixin:
#     def get_queryset(self):
#         qs = super().get_queryset()
#         return qs.filter(user=self.request.user)
# Apply it to class-based views:

# python
# class GroupListView(UserQueryMixin, ListView):
#     model = Group
# This ensures every query is scoped without repeating yourself.

# âœ… 3. Override save() to Auto-Assign user
# In models where user is required:

# python
# class Expense(models.Model):
#     ...
#     user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

#     def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
#         if not self.user and hasattr(self, '_current_user'):
#             self.user = self._current_user
#         super().save(*args, **kwargs)
# Then in your view:

# python
# expense = Expense(...)
# expense._current_user = request.user
# expense.save()
# Or use a custom form that injects user on save(commit=False).

# âœ… 4. Middleware for Multi-Tenant Isolation (Optional)
# If you scale to tenant-level isolation:

# python
# class CurrentUserMiddleware:
#     def __init__(self, get_response):
#         self.get_response = get_response

#     def __call__(self, request):
#         UserContext.set(request.user)
#         return self.get_response(request)
# Then use UserContext.get() inside models or managers.

# ðŸ§  Why This Works for You
# Automates safety: You wonâ€™t forget to filter by user

# Modular: Reusable across apps (expenses, labels, groups)

# Scalable: Ready for multi-tenant logic

# Privacy-first: Prevents accidental data leakage
